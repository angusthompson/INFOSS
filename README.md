# INFOSS
Interferometer for Neutrino Flavour Oscillations on a Schwarzschild Spacetime

To install simply download everything into the same directory.

The 'INFOSS' file will produce the main results, from which specific values for each intercept will be stored in 
'PreviousPlots', 'Previousr', 'Previoustheta', 'Previousoscprob', and 'checkpoints'.

'DoubleParticleTest' allows the limits of the code to be tested along specified trajectories.

Full credit for the calculation of neutrino trajectories goes to Pierre Christian and Chi-Kwan Chan, whose programme 'FANTASY' was used in the 'GeodesicIntegrator' module of INFOSS. FANTASY can be found at https://github.com/pierrechristian/FANTASY.
